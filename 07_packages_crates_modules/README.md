Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your codeâ€™s organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private, and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the module system, include:

- Packages: Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
- Crates: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
- Modules and `use`: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
- Paths: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or modules
