Cargo is designed so you can extend it with new subcommands without having to modify Cargo. 
If a binary in your `$PATH` is named `cargo-something`, you can run it as if it was a Cargo 
subcommand by running `cargo something`. 
Custom commands like this are also listed when you run `cargo --list`. 
Being able to use cargo install to install extensions and then run them just like the 
built-in Cargo tools is a super convenient benefit of Cargoâ€™s design!
